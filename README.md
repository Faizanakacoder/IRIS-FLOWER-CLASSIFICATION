## 📄 Project Summary
The Iris dataset is the "Gold Standard" for classification benchmarks. As part of my **CodSoft Data Science Internship (Task 3)**, I engineered a robust machine learning pipeline to distinguish between **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** species. By leveraging morphological feature analysis, the model identifies species with **100% accuracy**.

### 🎯 Core Objective
Develop a highly accurate **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** or **Random Forest** model to automate the identification of floral species based on physical dimensions.

## 📊 Visual Insights (EDA)
*Uncovering the patterns that define nature.*

### 1. Species Clustering Analysis
The **Pair Plot** illustrates the clear separation of species. **Setosa** exists in its own cluster, while **Versicolor** and **Virginica** present a fascinating classification challenge due to their proximity.

### 2. The MVP Features
My feature importance analysis reveals that **Petal Length** and **Petal Width** are the most critical predictors, significantly outperforming sepal dimensions in classification power.

### 3. Model Performance Evaluation
The results are definitive. With zero misclassifications, the **Confusion Matrix** and **Classification Report** reflect a perfect **1.0 score** across Precision, Recall, and F1-metrics.
